# Dotfile Repository for Bas Langenberg

This is my personal dotfile repo. I'm using this as a base for new installations or system I frequently work on.

An important note is that all bash related files are requiring [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it) to be installed and configured. 

Feel free to use this, although there will be much better examples over on Github. This is how *i* like it, and it's standing on the shoulders of giants.

As always, this is a work in progress and will never be done.
